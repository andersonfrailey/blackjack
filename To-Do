- Add a class to handle the data generated from each hand
    - Class should have a function to add the hand information to a DataFrame
      - Data function will have a single DataFrame as an argument, concat
        it to a larger DataFrame with the rest of the hand data
    - Data exported should include seat position and card count
    - Export function to add data to a CSV file that has already been made
    - What if it could write to an online database so that every time it ran
      the program could add a bunch of additional data to gain more insight?
    - Part of the data should be given by the hit function that gives the count
      and the resulting value of the card received from the hit. Can be used to
      figure probability of a card of a certain value (or bellow a certain value)
      coming up given the count of the deck. For all of the counts, what % of
      the cards that occur in the count are of each value? For all the card
      values, at what count do they appear most frequently?
    - What % of the time a dealer shows an ace do they have blackjack? And is
      that related at all to what the count is?

- Function to store all the data in a previously made csv file: probably will
  go in the utils file
  - Could just read the initial csv file in as a DataFrame, add onto that
    DataFrame will append function, then re-write the csv at the end of the
    process

- Add routine for placing bets
- Ability to play a game of blackjack
  - If possible, print out probability of busting, winning, etc. based on the
    count, your total, and dealer's up card. Won't work well until a significant
    number of hands have been played.
    eg:
    "Your total is _. You have a _% chance of winning if you stand. You have
     a _% chance of busting if you hit. The probability the dealer busts is _"
   - Could use the functions found in game.py, just don't call play game
   - Change play_game to sim_game and have it's params be number of players,
     number of hands, etc.
   - Give user the ability to picks the number of people they play with

- Add method for adding a card that can replace the repeated code
