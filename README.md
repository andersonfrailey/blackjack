# Blackjack Simulator
This repo currently only contains a blackjack simulator. An example of how to use the simulator can be found in the [sample notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/andersonfrailey/blackjack/blob/master/Sample%20Notebook.ipynb).

Data from the simulations is not saved anywhere, but the scripts can be easily edited for that purpose.

Down the road, I'm looking to add a CLI to allow users to actually play blackjack, rather than just simulate a million hands.

I'm also working on a program that will be able to play blackjack on its own using the information collected in the simulations.
